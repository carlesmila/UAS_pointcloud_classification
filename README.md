# UAS: Point cloud classification (IFGI project 2020)

## Introduction

This repository contains the code used to perfom supervised classification for the UAS project as a part of the work performed by the 3D data team. 
This project was conducted during the summer semester 2020 in IFGI (University of Münster), in which UAV data (RGB + MS) was collected to study
the renaturation process of the river Aa in the segment near the Aa lake in Münster, Germany. The 3D data team analysed 3D data including point clouds 
and digital elevation/terrain models to study a series of morphological characteristics of the river. To do so, a preliminary classification of the point
cloud was required.
